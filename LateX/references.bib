  abstract = {Despite the plethora of irrigation scheduling decision support systems that have been developed over the past decades, there is little evidence of widespread adoption by farmers. This paper investigates the structural, institutional and political rigidities that affect the adoption of irrigation scheduling technologies in southern European countries and highlights the corresponding opportunities. The recent implementation of water pricing policies, as required under the European Water Framework Directive, could motivate farmers to invest in technologies for improving water management. A review of irrigation water prices in southern Europe found a large range of prices both within and between countries, from 0.054–0.645 €/m3 (Greece) to 0.23–1.50 €/m3 (France). However, inadequate monitoring infrastructure and a lack of political will to impose the new water prices are giving a mixed signal to farmers. An ageing and poorly trained farm population, small farm size and low level of farm investment also impede the uptake of irrigation technologies. Within this context, European-funded research needs to consider these constraints and pay closer attention to the conversion of knowledge and innovation into successful commercial products.},

Here we find the current practical range of multi-copters to be about 4\,km with current battery technology, requiring a new network of urban warehouses or waystations as support. We show that, although drones consume less energy per package-km than delivery trucks, the additional warehouse energy required and the longer distances traveled by drones per package greatly increase the life-cycle impacts. Still, in most cases examined, the impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based delivery. Results suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the freight sector. To realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery, regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and limiting the size of drones.},

  abstract = {Aircraft emissions affect air quality on scales from local to global. More than 20\% of the jet fuel used in the U.S. is consumed by military aircraft, and emissions from this source are facing increasingly stringent environmental regulations, so improved methods for quickly and accurately determining emissions from existing and new engines are needed. This paper reports results of a study to advance the methods used for detailed characterization of military aircraft emissions, and provides emission factors for two aircraft: the F-15 fighter and the C-130 cargo plane. The measurements involved outdoor ground-level sampling downstream behind operational military aircraft. This permits rapid change-out of the aircraft so that engines can be tested quickly on operational aircraft. Measurements were made at throttle settings from idle to afterburner using a simple extractive probe in the dilute exhaust. Emission factors determined using this approach agree very well with those from the traditional method of extractive sampling at the exhaust exit. Emission factors are reported for CO2, CO, NO, NOx, and more than 60 hazardous and/or reactive organic gases. Particle size, mass and composition also were measured and are being reported separately. Comparison of the emissions of nine hazardous air pollutants from these two engines with emissions from nine other aircraft engines is discussed.},

  abstract = {Solar- and nuclear-electricity-generation technologies often are deemed “carbon-free” because their operation does not generate any carbon dioxide. However, this is not so when considering their entire lifecycle of energy production; carbon dioxide and other gases are emitted during the extraction, processing, and disposal of associated materials. We determined the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, namely, CO2, CH4, N2O, and chlorofluorocarbons due to materials and energy flows throughout all stages of the life of commercial technologies for solar-electric- and nuclear-power generation, based on data from 12 photovoltaic (PV) companies, and reviews of nuclear-fuel life cycles in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Previous GHG estimates vary widely, from 40 to 180 CO2-eq./kWh for PV, and 3.5–100 CO2-eq./kWh for nuclear power. Country-specific parameters account for many of these differences, which are exacerbated by outdated information. We conclude, instead, that lifetime GHG emissions from solar- and nuclear-fuel cycles in the United States are comparable under actual production conditions and average solar irradiation, viz., 22–49g CO2-eq./kWh (average US), 17–39g CO2-eq./kWh (south west) for solar electric, and 16–55g CO2-eq./kWh for nuclear energy. However, several factors may significantly change this picture within the next 5 years, and there are unanswered questions about the nuclear fuel cycle that warrant further analyses.},

  abstract = {¡p¿Swarm systems consist of large numbers of agents that collaborate autonomously. With an appropriate level of human control, swarm systems could be applied in a variety of contexts ranging from urban search and rescue situations to cyber defence. However, the successful deployment of the swarm in such applications is conditioned by the effective coupling between human and swarm. While adaptive autonomy promises to provide enhanced performance in human-machine interaction, distinct factors must be considered for its implementation within human-swarm interaction. This paper reviews the multidisciplinary literature on different aspects contributing to the facilitation of adaptive autonomy in human-swarm interaction. Specifically, five aspects that are necessary for an adaptive agent to operate properly are considered and discussed, including mission objectives, interaction, mission complexity, automation levels, and human states. We distill the corresponding indicators in each of the five aspects, and propose a framework, named MICAH (i.e., Mission-Interaction-Complexity-Automation-Human), which maps the primitive state indicators needed for adaptive human-swarm teaming.¡/p¿}

  abstract = {Robotic systems composed of a large number of entities, often called robot swarms, are envisioned to play an increasingly important role in applications such as search, rescue, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. Nowadays, many mobile robots that are deployed for such applications are still tele-operated by a single or multiple operators. While these platforms are individually very capable, the development of cheaper hardware allows the consideration of swarm systems composed of many more robots but with each individual being far less powerful. Examples from biology indicate that such systems can be collectively more powerful than any individual robot within the team and also more than many larger, more sophisticated individual robots. Enabling a human to control such bio-inspired systems is a considerable challenge due to the limitations of each individual robot and the sheer number of robots that need to be coordinated to successfully complete a mission. Autonomous algorithms provide an opportunity to mitigate some of the complexity an operator faces in controlling such swarms, but it is not clear either (a) which tasks will ultimately need to be executed by the operator rather than by the swarm, or (b) what kinds of interactions would be needed.},

It is demonstrated that manoeuvrability and endurance are the main characteristics when choosing air tactical aircraft; focus is on load capability for helicopters and air tankers. Water tank filling and deployment techniques are evaluated. Aircraft using pressure deployment systems are found to produce more uniform and heavy coverage in comparison with gravity systems. ADS-B open source data of flight operations and performance was collected. Operational patterns are found to be independent on the size of particular aircraft category (non-amphibious and amphibious air tanker, helicopter, air-tactical aircraft). Effectiveness and cost are modelled using the retardant dropped per operation and the average number of daily missions. The largest aircraft, Type-I helicopters and very large air tankers (VLAT) are found to be the most effective water- and retardant-dropping aircraft. The best cost-to-litre-dropped ratio for water-dropping aircraft is attributed to Type-III helicopters and amphibious Type-III aircraft; for retardant-dropping aircraft, VLAT are most effective. To maximise fire fighting effectiveness, Type-I helicopters and VLAT should be used as far as possible, with pressure deployment systems.},

  abstract = {The process of globalization is being significantly influenced by the integration of technology, and among the technological advancements, drone technology stands out as a prominent example. Drones have witnessed a remarkable increase in their usage across various disciplines, including agriculture, healthcare, and military domains. In agriculture, drones provide farmers with real-time data, empowering them to make well-informed decisions about the utilization of farm inputs. Additionally, drones serve a vital role in the healthcare sector by enabling the aerial delivery of essential medical supplies, such as blood, vaccines, drugs, and laboratory samples, to remote areas in developing nations during critical health emergencies. In the military realm, drones contribute to enhancing security and surveillance operations by monitoring enemy movements and facilitating targeted actions. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that despite their numerous benefits, drones can pose risks, such as potential injuries to individuals and damage to property, especially when operated by untrained personnel or in the event of component failures during flight. Moreover, extremist elements can be hijacking drones to further their agendas and redirect the payload accordingly. This paper aims to comprehensively analyze the current developments in agricultural, medical, and military drones through a rigorous examination of their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. \&nbsp;},

  abstract = {This paper examines the potential use of fire extinguishing balls as part of a proposed system, where drone and remote-sensing technologies are utilized cooperatively as a supplement to traditional firefighting methods. The proposed system consists of (1) scouting unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to detect spot fires and monitor the risk of wildfire approaching a building, fence, and/or firefighting crew via remote sensing, (2) communication UAS to establish and extend the communication channel between scouting UAS and fire-fighting UAS, and (3) a fire-fighting UAS autonomously traveling to the waypoints to drop fire extinguishing balls (environmental friendly, heat activated suppressants). This concept is under development through a transdisciplinary multi-institutional project. The scope of this paper encloses general illustration of this design, and the experiments conducted so far to evaluate fire extinguishing balls. The results of the experiments show that smaller size fire extinguishing balls available in the global marketplace attached to drones might not be effective in aiding in building fires (unless there are open windows in the buildings already). On the contrary, results show that even the smaller size fire extinguishing balls might be effective in extinguishing short grass fires (around 0.5 kg size ball extinguished a circle of 1-meter of short grass). This finding guided the authors towards wildfire fighting rather than building fires. The paper also demonstrates building of heavy payload drones (around 15 kg payload), and the progress of development of an apparatus carrying fire-extinguishing balls attachable to drones.},

  abstract = {Fires represent one of the most predominant and destructive disasters, which tend to be rapidly increasing and nearly impossible to control. Conventional firefighting methods, which rely on human intervention, are normally time-consuming and unsafe. The implementation of drones for fire prevention and extinguishing provides an efficient substitute, permitting rapid and safe access to areas, which are inaccessible to human firefighters. Building on the successful completion of our previous project with the Department of Civil Defense, entitled "System for Detection, Prediction, and Analysis using IoT," concluded in December 2022, we propose the second part to create a new initiative: "Automatic Fire Extinguishing and Prevention using Drones." This project aims to enhance an automated system that can detect and extinguish fires in real-time, and thus reduce damage to properties and save lives. This system aims to leverage drone technology by developing the efficiency and safety of fire management operations. Drones equipped with thermal cameras, sensors, and fire-suppressant delivery mechanisms are used to detect fire outbreaks early and respond instantly. These drones can access severe areas that are difficult for human firefighters to approach, by providing a more rapid and safer means of combating fires. By integrating real-time data analysis and autonomous navigation, this system allows incessant monitoring and rapid response to different fire incidents. Eventually, the deployment of drones for automatic fire extinguishing and prevention can revolutionise conventional firefighting methods by producing significant improvement in protecting lives and property from the devastating impacts of fires.},

abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract = {This work presents the extension of a physical model for the spreading of surface fire at landscape scale. In previous work, the model was validated at laboratory scale for fire spreading across litters. The model was then modified to consider the structure of actual vegetation and was included in the wildland fire calculation system Forefire that allows converting the two-dimensional model of fire spread to three dimensions, taking into account spatial information. Two wildland fire behavior case studies were elaborated and used as a basis to test the simulator. Both fires were reconstructed, paying attention to the vegetation mapping, fire history, and meteorological data. The local calibration of the simulator required the development of appropriate fuel models for shrubland vegetation (maquis) for use with the model of fire spread. This study showed the capabilities of the simulator during the typical drought season characterizing the Mediterranean climate when most wildfires occur.}

  abstract = {Devastating wildfires in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas in 2016 and 2017 resulted in significant social, economic, and environmental losses, with the agricultural sector among those severely affected. Several satellite-based indices were evaluated as potential monitoring tools for post-wildfire ecological recovery and management of grasslands. All indices evaluated provided useful information and indicated rapid vegetation recovery from wildfire. The Leaf Water Stress Index (LSWI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) showed a distinct response to the wildfire events, and differentiated between burned and unburned areas throughout the post-wildfire growing seasons better than the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI). In particular, the LSWI may provide a useful tool for mapping the footprint of wildfire, with potential utility for organizations that provide post-fire recovery resources. The GPP, which estimates the biomass productivity of vegetation, can provide information to livestock operators to guide the re-stocking of cattle in the aftermath of wildfire. In sum, satellite-based proxies can provide timely information both to characterize a wildfire’s footprint and to guide post-fire grazing management in a manner that balances short term needs for forage with long-term productivity and ecological function.},

  abstract = {The article describes a new method of describing wildfires spreading and extinguishing based on agent-based models. The agent approach in conjunction with geoinformation systems (GIS) permits to efficiently describe the interaction of a big number of participants of wildfire fighting: spreading fire, fire brigades, means of mechanization, air means, etc. In the current paper, this approach is illustrated by an example of two types of agents denoted as A and B. The burning fire line is seen as a chain of type A agents, each of which imitates burning of an elementary area of vegetable fuel. The fire line movement is described by Hamilton–Jacobi equation and is calculated based on the moving grid algorithm. Agents of another type—B-agents—describe fire extinguishing, they approach the agents of A type and affect them decreasing fire intensity to zero. This model is presented by a GIS-oriented software system which may be enhanced and be useful both for fire control management and training personnel in wildfire fighting tactics.}
